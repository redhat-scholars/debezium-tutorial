= Debezium UI
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Apache Kafka Connect provides a https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_rest[REST API] to manage (start, pause, stop, configure, ...) and inspect (connector plugins, connector instances/tasks, ...) connectors. While this very helpful to automate certain activities related to connector management, it might not be the to most convenient way for humans to explore and work with Kafka Connect deployments.

In order to address this need, Debezium provides a web-based user interface (https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/operations/debezium-ui.html[Debezium UI]) composed of a frontend (written in React + Patternfly) and a backend (written in https://quarkus.io[Quarkus]), which talks to Kafka Connect's REST API behind the scenes. The following exercise shows and explains how to run Debezium UI in order to manage and inspect connector plugins for Apache Kafka Connect.

== Start required services as containers

The required infrastructure consists of 5 containers (zookeeper, kafka, connect, mysql, dbzui) which can be launched with either Podman or Docker using the provided https://compose-spec.io/[compose file] in `./apps/infra/elementary/dbz-ui/compose.yaml` as follows:

== Run Debezium Source Connector

=== Open Debezium UI

Provided that all containers are up and running fine, go to your favorite web-browser and open `http://localhost:8080`. This should bring up the currently empty dashboard of Debezium UI:

image::dbz-ui-dashboard-empty.png["Empty Dashboard Debezium UI"]

=== Create MySQL Source Connector

Click the "Create a connector" button which brings up the form-based wizard for creating new connector instances. Make sure that to click and select the "MySQL Database" tile from the available database options and click "Next" at the bottom of the page.

image::dbz-ui-create-connector-wizard-type-marked.png["Debezium UI Connector Wizard - Type"]

=== Define Basic Connector Properties

The next screen of the wizard asks you to specify the major settings for the MySQL source connector. Enter the following values into the respective form fields:

image::dbz-ui-create-connector-wizard-basic-props.png["Debezium UI Connector Wizard - Basic Properties"]

* **Connector name:** `my-dbz-mysql-src`
* **Topic prefix:** `mydb1`
* **Cluster ID:** `12345`
* **Hostname:** `mysql`
* **User:** `debezium`
* **Password:** `dbz`
* **Kafka broker addresses:** `kafka:9092`
* **Database schema history topic name:** `dbhistory.inventory`

Scroll to the bottom and hit the "Validate" button to verify the specified settings.

image::dbz-ui-create-connector-wizard-validated.png[Debezium UI Connector Wizard - Basic Properties Validation]

Afterwards, click the "Next" button to bring up the wizard screen for entering "Additional properties".

=== Define Additional Connector Properties

Enter the following values into the respective form fields:

image::dbz-ui-create-connector-wizard-additional-props-filters-marked.png[Debezium UI Connector Wizard - Additional Properties - Filter Definitions]

NOTE: Only after entering values for database and/or table filter do the "include/exclude" buttons become enabled. By default, when entering a filter it is set to be of type _include_

* **Database filter:** `inventory`
* **Table filter:** `inventory.customers,inventory.addresses`

These settings will instruct the Debezium MySQL source connector to only snapshot and capture change events for the two table `customers` and `addresses` in the `inventory` database. This means any other databases and tables in the MySQL server instance will be skipped/ignored by Debezium.

Since there are no more additional settings needed for this example it is safe to **skip other wizard dialogs by clicking "Review and finish"** which brings up the final review for all the configured settings:

image::dbz-ui-create-connector-wizard-review-finish.png["Debezium UI Connector Wizard - Review / Finish"]

**Confirm by clicking the "Finish" button.**


=== Verify MySQL Connector in Dashboard

After a few moments, the dashboard should show the successfully running MySQL source connector instance `my-dbz-mysql-src` like so:

image::dbz-ui-dashboard-running-connector.png["Debezium UI - Dashboard with running MySQL Connector"]

**A click on the ">" sign** of the connector expands the table row entry and shows a few more runtime details of the connector instance:

image::dbz-ui-dashboard-running-connector-expanded.png["Debezium UI - Dashboard with running MySQL Connector Expanded View"]

**By clicking on the connector name** in the table row entry it's possible to inspect the connector configuration details either by means of a tabular or a JSON view:

image::dbz-ui-dashboard-running-connector-name-click.png["Debezium UI - Dashboard with running MySQL Connector Config"]

image::dbz-ui-dashboard-running-connector-details-table-view.png["Debezium UI - Dashboard with running MySQL Connector Config Table View"]

image::dbz-ui-dashboard-running-connector-details-json-view.png["Debezium UI - Dashboard with running MySQL Connector Config JSON View"]

== Inspect CDC records in Kafka topics

Now that the connector has been successfully started and is running fine in the background, it is time to inspect snapshot and change data capture events in the corresponding Apache Kafka topics.

=== Consume CDC events for Customers

The Podman/Docker command from above should print all snapshot and change events which Debezium captured for the MySQL database table `inventory.customers`. Below is one such exemplary Kafka record for the customer record having `id=1004`.
